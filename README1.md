# Final Project Lihui Chen
Description

This is a webpage about the comparison of four major online crowdsourcing websites. This is a static webpage and I have localized it into the following three languages: Chinese, Japanese and Lao. The webpage is quite simple, with contents, several pictures and content columns. The webpage is to brief on the translation crowdsourcing to more people around the world.
